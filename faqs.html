					<button class="accordion">Q: I registered late for Stat 100. How can I make up late homework?</button>
				<div class="panel">
                    <p>A: <i>We drop your 3 lowest HW assignments so if you register late, the one or two assignments you miss will count as dropped assignments. Even though you won't get credit, we still encourage you to try the homework assignments you miss as practice on Lon Capa. </i></p>
                </div>

					<button class="accordion">Q: I've had an emergency and was unable to do the homework in time. What should I do?</button>
				<div class="panel">	
                    <p>A: <i> At some point or another, many of you will miss a HW or two due to unforeseen circumstances. This is why we allow you to drop your 3 lowest scores. </i></p>
                		</div>

					<button class="accordion">Q: I have a technical glitch with Lon Capa that is not allowing me to complete the homework. What should I do?</button> 
                    <div class="panel">
                    <p>A: <i>Contact our technical specialist, David Collier <a href="mailto:dacollie@illinois.edu">(dacollie@illinois.edu)</a>. Take a screenshot of what you are seeing and describe the problem thoroughly. Remember, there's bound to be computer glitches sometimes so try to start your homework early so you don't miss the assignment due date. Again, if you do miss the due date because of technical issues, it will just count as a dropped homework. </i></p>

				<div class="panel">	
					<p>A: <i>There are no make up exams for Stat 100. If you miss an exam and have a valid written excuse from McKinley, a doctor, the emergency dean, etc, we will excuse you from the exam and make your final exam worth 45% of your grade.</i></p>

                <div class="panel">
					<p>A: <i>If you notify us at least a week in advance, we'll try our best to find another time for you to take the test. If you notify us with less than a week's notice, we will substitute your final exam score in for that exam (assuming it's a legitimate conflict).</i></p>

					<p>A: <i> Do the <a href="http://www.stat.illinois.edu/courses/stat100/exams_practice2.html" target="blank">practice exams</a> as REAL exams without peeking at your notes or the key. The key is to take the practice exams under real conditions, then grade yourself, identify weak areas, and study what you got wrong. Keep doing practice exams until you are consistently getting the grade you want on the real exam. Come to office hours to get help!</i></p>

                <div class="panel">

				<div class="panel">
                    <p>A: <i>The <a href="http://registrar.illinois.edu/spring2017schedulingguidelinespublic" target="blank">university schedules the finals</a> based on when your class meets- so unless it's an online class, you should not have two finals that overlap unless your other professor isn't using the date that's assigned.  If that's the case (or if the class is online), they are required to offer a conflict so please contact them.</i></p>

                    <p> A: For Online Stat 100 students:<i> If you have a final during the time(s) that we offer the Stat 100 final, follow instructions above for requesting a conflict final.</i></p>
